DERIV WORM STRATEGY RULESET

This document contains the complete logic for the V3 Worm Engine.

CORE PRINCIPLE:
The main goal is to identify the dominant trend (UP or DOWN) based on the sequence of even and odd digits and their relationship to visual levels.

RULE 1: DIFFERENCE OF 1
This is the most fundamental rule. It triggers when two consecutive digits have a difference of 1 unit, including the wrap-around from 9 to 0.
Example: 7 followed by 8, or 2 followed by 1.
If the second digit is higher, the signal is UP.
If the second digit is lower, the signal is DOWN.

RULE 2: DOMINANT EVEN/ODD
This rule analyzes the last 7 digits to see if even or odd numbers are dominant.
If even numbers are significantly more frequent than odd numbers, the signal is UP.
If odd numbers are significantly more frequent than even numbers, the signal is DOWN.

RULE 3: BREAKOUT
This rule identifies when the latest digit breaks out of the high or low of the last 5 digits.
If the latest digit is the highest in the last 5, the signal is UP.
If the latest digit is the lowest in the last 5, the signal is DOWN.

RULE 4: VISUAL ZERO AND ANOMALY
This is a more advanced rule. It visualizes digits in space and compares them against a central "zero" level.
An anomaly is when a sequence of digits (e.g., 7, 5, 3) falls instead of rises (for blue numbers).
If an anomaly is detected and breaks a level, the trend may reverse.
Example: A sequence 7 (blue), 5 (blue), 4 (red) is a falling anomaly. The next step determines the direction.

RULE 5: FIVE-TICK PREDICTION
The engine's predictions are evaluated over the next 5 ticks to determine their accuracy (WIN or LOSS).
This is not a direct signal rule but a core part of the learning mechanism.

EXECUTION LOGIC:
The engine prioritizes rules in this order:
1. Exact PDF mappings (if provided).
2. Difference of 1.
3. Breakout.
4. Dominant Even/Odd.
5. Momentum and Frequency Analysis.

Always be attentive to the trend movement and comply with all rules for success.

THE DERIV WORM ENGINE: A TRADER'S COMPANION

SECOND EDITION

CHAPTER 1: THE PHILOSOPHY OF DIGITAL TRENDS

Welcome to the Worm Engine. At its heart, this system is not about predicting the future, but about understanding the present momentum of the market. The market, like a worm, moves in segments. Our goal is to identify the direction of the next segment by analyzing the characteristics of the last few.

We do not rely on luck. We rely on logic, patterns, and probability. Every digit that appears is a piece of a puzzle. By understanding the rules of this puzzle, we can trade with confidence, not hope.

CHAPTER 2: THE FIVE PILLARS OF ANALYSIS

Our entire strategy is built upon five core analytical pillars. A trade signal is only generated when one or more of these pillars align.

PILLAR 1: THE ADJACENT STEP (DIFFERENCE OF 1)
This is our most fundamental and reliable signal. It occurs when two consecutive digits are adjacent on the number line (e.g., 4 and 5, 8 and 7).
This includes the critical wrap-around case: 9 followed by 0 is a step UP, and 0 followed by 9 is a step DOWN.
This is a direct, high-probability signal of immediate momentum.

PILLAR 2: THE DOMINANT FORCE (EVEN VS. ODD)
Digits are not just numbers; they have characteristics: Even or Odd. We analyze the last 7 ticks to determine which characteristic is dominant.
If Even digits (0, 2, 4, 6, 8) significantly outnumber Odd digits (1, 3, 5, 7, 9), the market is showing "Even strength," which we interpret as an UP trend.
Conversely, if Odd digits are dominant, we interpret this as a DOWN trend.
This pillar identifies the underlying bias of the market.

PILLAR 3: THE BREAKOUT
Markets move in ranges. A breakout is a powerful event where the price moves outside its recent high or low.
We monitor the last 5 ticks. If the latest digit is the highest of these 5, it is an UP breakout.
If it is the lowest, it is a DOWN breakout.
This pillar confirms the start of a new, potentially strong trend.

PILLAR 4: THE VISUAL ZERO & ANOMALIES
This is our most advanced pillar. We visualize the digits in a coordinate space (our "Visual Zero"). A rising trend is a sequence of increasing blue numbers. A falling trend is a sequence of increasing red numbers.
An "anomaly" is when this pattern breaks. For example, if blue numbers start to fall (7, 5, 3), it's an anomaly.
An anomaly that breaks a level is a strong signal that the trend is about to reverse. This is our "Pivot Point."

PILLAR 5: THE FIVE-TICK EVALUATION
This is not a signal, but our learning mechanism. Every prediction we make is judged over the next 5 ticks.
Did the market move in the direction we predicted? This is recorded as a WIN or a LOSS.
This data is used to weight our rules, making the engine smarter over time. Rules that perform well gain more influence.

CHAPTER 3: THE EXECUTION PROTOCOL

The Worm Engine executes trades with precision and discipline. The process is as follows:

1.  OBSERVE: The engine constantly ingests the last digits.
2.  ANALYZE: It runs the digits through all five pillars.
3.  DECIDE: If a pillar generates a clear signal, it's presented.
4.  WEIGHT: The signal's confidence is boosted or reduced based on its historical performance (Accuracy Booster).
5.  TRADE: If Auto-trade is enabled, a contract is proposed and purchased based on the final, weighted decision.

The engine prioritizes signals in this order: Mappings > Adjacent Step > Breakout > Dominant Force > Frequency/Momentum.

CHAPTER 4: RISK MANAGEMENT: THE TRADER'S SHIELD

A brilliant strategy is useless without disciplined risk management. Our engine includes built-in protections:

-   STOP-LOSS: Automatically stops trading if a session loss reaches a predefined limit.
-   TAKE-PROFIT: Automatically stops trading after a session profit target is hit.
-   MAX TRADES: Prevents over-trading in a single session.
-   MARTINGALE CONTROL: An optional, high-risk tool. Use with extreme caution. It doubles the stake after a loss to recover previous losses. It can lead to rapid gains or rapid ruin.

Remember: The goal is not to win every trade. The goal is to be profitable over time. Protect your capital at all costs.

FINAL WORDS:

The market is a river of data. You cannot control its flow, but you can build a boat to navigate it. The Worm Engine is your boat. Study its rules, understand its logic, and trade with the confidence of a strategist, not the fear of a gambler.

Trade well.
